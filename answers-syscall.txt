    q1:
        the function usertrap() defined in kernel/trap.c
        called syscall
    q2:
        the value of p->trapframe->a7 is 7
        according to kernel/syscall.h this value
        represents SYS_exec
    q3:
        the value of the sstatus register is 0x22, meaning
        the SIE and SPIE bits are set to one. if i understand
        correctly, according to the RISC-V priviliged
        instructions file, this means that in the previous
        CPU mode, supervisor interrupts were enabled.
        i didn't find any more information regarding the
        previous CPU mode
    q4:
        the kernel is panicing at the assembly lw instruction.
        the a3 register corresponds to num
    q5:
        the faulting assembly instruction is indeed the one i
        found above.
        the kernel address space starts at 0x80000000. kernel
        should not be able to read from address 0. this is
        why the kernel crashes.
        the scause register was set to 0xd. according to the
        risc-v priviliged insctructions file, 0xd represents
        load page fault, which sounds about right
    q6:
        the name of the binary running when the kernel paniced
        is 'initcode'. it's pid is 1.
